# Traffic_Sign
There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc.
Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.

# Traffic Signs Recognition â€“ About the Python Project
In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model,
we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

# Dataset
For this project, we are using the public dataset available at Kaggle:

The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying,
some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. The size of the dataset is around 300 MB. 
The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.

# Prerequisites
This project requires prior knowledge of: 
- Keras, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas, PIL and image classification.
- pip install tensorflow keras sklearn matplotlib pandas pil

# Approach
Our approach to building this traffic sign classification model is discussed in four steps:

- Explore the dataset
- Build a CNN model
- Train and validate the model
- Test the model with test dataset

# Summary
In this Python project we have successfully classified the traffic signs classifier with 93% accuracy and also visualized how our accuracy and loss changes with time, 
which is pretty good from a simple CNN model.
